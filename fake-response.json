Here are the accessibility issues I identified in the provided code changes:

Explanation:
1. The SubmitButton component uses CSS opacity and pointerEvents to visually disable the button when loading. This makes the button appear non-interactive to sighted users, but it's still focusable and operable via keyboard or screen reader, failing WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard.

2. The Modal component is not trapping keyboard focus within the modal when open. Users can tab out of the modal and interact with background content, which can be confusing and disorienting, especially for screen reader users. This fails WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap.

3. The close button in the Modal uses a span element, which is not natively focusable or interactive. It needs a proper button role and keyboard event handling to be accessible.

4. The ContactForm has inputs without associated labels. Placeholder text is not an acceptable replacement for a label, as it disappears when the user starts typing and is not reliably announced by screen readers. This fails WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships and 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions.

5. The name input error message is always present in the DOM, just hidden with display: none. This makes it invisible but still announced by screen readers, which is confusing. Error messages should only be present when relevant.

6. The name input error message is not associated with the input itself. Screen reader users may not understand which input the error refers to. This fails WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages.

Suggested fixes:
